We are the GROUP 22:

In order to try the code, you will have to copy and paste all the documents. Please be careful
and change the “namespace”.
In our code, there already are some data:
- 1 Admin: Login: 1 -- Password: a;
- 1 teacher: Login: 10 -- Password: b; (He teaches the course “OOP” to the Group A and
his students has the ID: 100 and 200)
- 4 students: Logins: 100@gmail.com, 200@gmail.com, 300@gmail.com and
400@gmail.com -- Password: qwerty;
- Students 100 and 200 are in the group A
- Students 200 and 300 are in the group B
